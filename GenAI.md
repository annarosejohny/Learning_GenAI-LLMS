## Applications of GenAI
- Text generation
  - relationship between words and phrases. These models can generate contextually relevant text.
  - Generating narrative - langauge translation eg:GPT
- Image generation
  - Image generation from **text input**. eg: DALL-E( data analysis learning with language model for generation and exploration)
  - From **seed image or random input** eg:GAN ( generative adversarial networks)
  - Used for creating images from **sketches** eg:fusion models
- Audio
  - Natural-sounding speech
  - Text-to-speech synthesis eg: WaveNet
- 3D
- Music
- Content creation
  - Articles, blogs, marketing materials, visuals, videos
- Condensing documents
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Data analysis

## GenAI Architecture and models
- RNN
  ![RNNS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dae7cd62-21a5-4996-9a72-2994a594d9a1)
  - Mechanism - **Fine tuning** - adjustments to weights, **Loop based design**
  - Applications - NLP, Language translation, speech recognition, image captioning
- Transformer
  ![Transformers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b94b9c4-971c-4797-b4b3-c689bdf43757)
  - Used to translate text, speech in realtime
  - Mechanism - **Feedback**, Parallelisation, **self-attention**
  - Eg:GPT - text generation
- GAN
  ![GANS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4b93cfe-e085-4be6-82b3-43d180c8ccc2)
  - Generator and disciminator
  - Mechanism - **Competitive approach**
  - Application- image or video generation
- VAE
  ![VAEs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90c84015-6d83-4f19-9cc4-991734942405)
  - Encoder and decoder
  - Learns patterns in data
  - Mechanism - **Characteristics based**- creates samples based on similar characteristics
  - Applications - Art and creative design
- Diffusion models
  - Trained to generate images by removing noise or recosntructing distorted data.
  - Used to generate high quality image from a distorted photo.
  - Mechanism - **Based on statistical properties**
